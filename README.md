# Work-Day-Scheduler

A Javascript file was created and linked to the HTML file. moment.js was also linked
to the HTML file.

Next, the current date was entered into Javascript via the moment format. Afterwards,
everything was centered.

Created time blocks using separate divs for each hour from 8am-6pm. Used <textarea> element as well as form elements
so the user is able to enter any specific information into their calendar.

Within each div is a save button. I used the <i> element for a save icon and found the 'fa fa-save' code for a simple icon.

In the Javascript file, localStorage is used to save any appointments that
the user may have written.

A forloop was created so that the webpage knew when to change the color of the time blocks based on the current time.
